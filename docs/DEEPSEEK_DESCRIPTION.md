# VaultKey: The Open-Source 1Password Clone - Complete Implementation Guide

## Project Overview

VaultKey is a secure, privacy-focused password manager Chrome extension that stores encrypted credentials locally and provides seamless autofill capabilities.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Chrome Extension APIs** (Manifest V3)
- **React 18** with TypeScript for UI components
- **libsodium.js** for cryptography (via `sodium-plus`)
- **IndexedDB** with Dexie.js for local storage
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Vite** for building and development
- **Jest** + **Testing Library** for testing

### Security Stack
- **Argon2id** for key derivation
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305** for encryption
- **Web Crypto API** for additional cryptographic operations
- **Secure Scrypt** for backup key derivation

## Epics and User Stories

### Epic 1: Chrome Extension Foundation
**Objective**: Establish the basic Chrome extension structure and development environment

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to set up a Chrome extension with Manifest V3 so that I can build a modern extension
- As a developer, I want to configure a React build process with hot reload so that I can develop efficiently
- As a user, I want to install the extension from the Chrome Web Store so that I can use it securely
- As a developer, I want to set up proper TypeScript configuration so that I can catch errors early

### Epic 2: Core Cryptography Engine
**Objective**: Implement secure encryption and key management

**User Stories**:
- As a security-conscious user, I want my master password to be used with Argon2id key derivation so that brute-force attacks are infeasible
- As a user, I want all my passwords encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305 so that my data remains confidential and tamper-proof
- As a user, I want the encryption key to be derived from my master password and never stored so that compromise is impossible without my password
- As a user, I want to verify that my master password is correct during unlock without leaking information

### Epic 3: Secure Vault Storage
**Objective**: Implement encrypted local storage and data management

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want my encrypted vault stored locally in IndexedDB so that I control my data
- As a user, I want to store login credentials with website URLs, usernames, and passwords so that I can organize my accounts
- As a user, I want to categorize my passwords with folders or tags so that I can find them easily
- As a user, I want my vault to be automatically locked after a period of inactivity so that my data remains secure

### Epic 4: Browser Extension UI
**Objective**: Create intuitive user interfaces for password management

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want a popup interface to quickly access and search my passwords so that I can find credentials fast
- As a user, I want a full options page to manage all my passwords and settings so that I have complete control
- As a user, I want to view, edit, and delete saved passwords in a secure interface so that I can manage my accounts
- As a user, I want to see password strength indicators so that I can identify weak passwords

### Epic 5: Password Capture & Autofill
**Objective**: Implement automatic form detection and filling

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want the extension to detect login forms and offer to save credentials so that I don't have to remember to save them manually
- As a user, I want to automatically fill login forms with one click so that logging in is effortless
- As a user, I want to choose which credentials to use when multiple accounts exist for a site so that I can use the right account
- As a user, I want the extension to update existing passwords when I change them so that my vault stays current

### Epic 6: Password Generator
**Objective**: Create a secure random password generator

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to generate strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets so that I can create secure passwords
- As a user, I want generated passwords to be automatically copied to clipboard so that I can use them immediately
- As a user, I want the option to generate memorable passphrases so that I can create passwords I can remember when needed

### Epic 7: Security & Session Management
**Objective**: Implement robust security controls and session handling

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to set a lock timeout after which I must re-enter my master password so that my data is protected when I step away
- As a user, I want the extension to clear sensitive data from memory when locked so that RAM scraping attacks are prevented
- As a user, I want the option to require master password for specific sensitive operations so that I have granular security control
- As a user, I want to export my encrypted vault for backup purposes so that I don't risk data loss
